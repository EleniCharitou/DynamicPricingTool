# DynamicPricingTool
This assignment is my thesis work. We have decided to build a graphic interface that is called **DIPSY**.
This thesis deals with the design and development of a graphical interface in an online shopping simulation system with the aim of developing 
dynamic pricing techniques. The graphical interface developed contains a form for filling in the parameters of an algorithmic model of pricing 
strategies, an interface for graphical visualization of user inputs and a corresponding interface for displaying the results of the system.
